// AX will update the relevant L03 table (without necessarily consulting the L23 table)

// the L3 mapping is flushed on all cpus.

// NOTE this is the WRONG primitive to do this, a guest should:
// 1) write an invalid entry into L23
// 2) ask AX to:
// 3)   write an invalid entry into L03
// 4)   flush the L03 mappings on all cpus
// 5)   write the correct entry in L03

// if the VMCS is not loaded on any CPU, AX will return 0 in RAX
// if it is in use AX will issue an IPI to cause it to be unloaded
// and return non-zero in RAX
// The guest should then pause and attempt the operation again until
// zero is returned or scheduling happens.
//
// NB IT IS THE GUEST'S RESPONSIBILITY NOT TO SHOOT ITSELF IN THE FOOT
// if a guest attempts a vmread/write/launch/resume with a vmcs that
// has been cleared from another cpu the operation will fail as if
// the vmcs had been loaded. Guests should use locks &c. to avoid misery.
